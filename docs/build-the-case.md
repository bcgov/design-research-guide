# Build the Case for User Research

## Staffing and Time Requirements
Quality research requires time, but don't let time constraints stop you from doing any user research. Some research is always better than none.

Expect members of your research team to dedicate at least 50 per cent of their workday to the project. While this may not be an extra expense, it could require temporarily shifting staff responsibilities. Of course, hiring a full-time user researcher is always an option.

## Researcher Roles and Responsibilities
You should always work in pairs when doing research. At a minimum you should assign team members to the first two roles:

- Moderator: As a moderator, you will lead the research session asking questions and directing activities. You will be responsible for the safety and comfort of the user for the entirety of the session.
- Recorder: As a recorder your job is to transcribes session, taking notes and photos. Having transcripts completed means you will be able to use them as reference and analysis
- Observer (optional): Observes watch the session and takes personal notes. This role will rotate with different project team members.

You shouldn't include more than one observer at a research session. Having too many people in the room can be intimating for participants.

## Involve the Whole Project Team
The benefits of having your executives and team as an observer to watch at least one user research session include:

- **Make suggestions that are user-centred:** Having other members participate in the research sessions will encourage them to prioritize user experience, rather than pursue design concepts that may not meet the user’s needs.
- **Credibility:** Your team will see that your design is based on research and not personal preference.
- **Buy-in:** Reviewing what happened in the research sessions as a group and determining priorities together (for example, which feature must be included, needs to be modified, could be implemented if there was more time, and should be removed) means you don’t have to spend a lot of time explaining your choices to stakeholders and convincing them that it’s the right approach.
- **Memorability:** It is easier to remember things when you experience them first hand, rather than read about them after.
- **Empathy:** You are able to relate to the user and understand why the service is not working for the user.

## Get Approval From Executives
Approval may be required before you start research, especially if you are doing complex research. Key questions that your executives may ask include

- Do you require a budget?
- Why are you talking to people?
- Who will you be talking to? And how many people?
- Have you completed the necessary Privacy Impact Assessment requirements? Creating a research plan is a good way to capture the scope and requirements for research, and can be used as a communication tool with your executive.

## Write a Research Plan
A research plan outlines the goals, approach and logistics for research, and should include:

- Research goals and questions
- Project background
- What kind of participants need to be involved, and how to recruit them
- The research approach including methods for research and analysis
- Research reporting plans
- Resources required, including team, time and budget including:
  - Travel requirements
  - Stipend budget
- A schedule for research activities and locations
- Support materials (if ready at this point in time) such as:
  - Interview scripts and workshop outlines
  - Recruiting screener to qualify research participants

This plan is simply a guide; the team may have to adapt on the fly to accommodate unexpected changes in schedules, participants or direction of the research.
