# Researcher Code of Conduct

As a researcher you will:

## Attitude
- Give people space to talk
- Let people think
- Respect ideas of participants
- Be respectful
- Listen more and talk less
- Not talk over, interrupt or finish sentences for people
- Be humble and express gratitude for a participant's time

## Land Recognition
- Recognize the traditional territory on which the session is being conducted. As part of B.C. government’s efforts towards Reconciliation, land recognition should be practiced whenever possible at the onset of an engagement or co-design session. The researcher may start with an informal introduction. However, before formally starting the engagement or interview, the researcher must recognize the traditional territory. We do the land recognition, to show our respect to the Nations on whose land we have been invited and also to give respect to the people we are engaging with.
- Ask the participant if they have other practices before formally starting a meeting or a research session.

## Informed Consent
- Be direct in communicating the intention and use of the research material collected
- Receive informed consent before starting a session
- Provide a [consent form](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/planning-research/consent.html) which outlines
  - Who is collecting the data
  - The purpose of the study (Why you are collecting the data)
  - Any [recordings](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/conduct-research.html#record-the-session) that will happen during the session and how information will be handled
  - What type of information will be recorded
  - How the information is going to be used
  - Who to contact if there are any questions

## Compensation
- Be respectful of people’s time and show appreciation through [stipends](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/planning-research/compensation.html). The underlying principle guiding this practice is that we value the participants experiences and stories, and participants should be compensated in a way that is fair and respectful. Individuals who have travelled for workshops and interviews for the purpose of the research will be compensated in a manner that is considered respectful for their time and effort. When handing over the gift card, the researcher should provide the context of why they are being given a gift card. Certain communities have some sensitivity around gift cards. Explain to those participating in the research the compensation process and how it is a common research practice.
- Develop an understanding of appropriate protocols and behaviours towards compensating those participating in the research.

## Cultural Awareness
- Identify appropriate cultural practices and protocols when interacting or engaging with people from different communities and diverse backgrounds.

## Setting
- Work in pairs or groups of three when conducting sessions on-site at people’s homes or public spaces
- Check in and out with supervisors before and after research activities.

## Working with Co-researchers
- Work with co-researchers (for example, social workers and community leaders) whenever possible, to make sure that practices meet the ethical and safety requirements of their organizations in order for them to participate in the research.
- Take steps to adjust practices where possible

## Emotional wellbeing
- Regularly debrief and check-in with one another after conversations
- Be mindful of the emotional weight of human-centered research.
- Seek out counselling or other psychological support if the need occurs during or after the research process. As government employees, we have access to free counseling services through the [Employee and Family Assistance Services](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/careers-myhr/all-employees/safety-health-well-being/health/efas), and will ensure all team members are aware of this offering.
