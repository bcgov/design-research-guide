# Ethical Practices for Research with Humans

As a researcher you will:

## Emotional wellbeing
- Recognize that for people from certain communities, sharing their personal stories and experiences of interacting with the government may bring up difficult emotions and memories tied to violence and/or traumas. As government officials interacting with people in vulnerable situations and experiences you should first acknowledge the historical relationships, inequity, trauma, and discrimination created by government and institutions.
- Provide the participants with a debriefing sheet that identifies contact information of local services, within their band or community, if they require support during or after the session.

## Anonymity and Privacy
- Respect the confidentiality of the participants that you speak to, and any other people, or events mentioned in their stories. The [anonymity](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/conduct-research.html#de-identify-your-notes) and [privacy of people](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/privacy-personal-information.html), who share their traumas and experiences, are guaranteed and paramount to any other interests.

## Setting
- Meet people at a [location](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/find-participants.html#pick-a-location) where and when they feel most comfortable speaking with you. Due to past experiences with government, some people might not feel comfortable inside a government building.

## Sharing Insights and Findings
- Be open to sharing generalized research insights and findings with participants, where appropriate

## Representation
- Include people in your research with a [cross-section of attributes](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/planning-research/#gender-based-analysis-in-research) as a way to understand the diverse experiences of people interacting with government services

## Recruitment
- Recruit whenever possible by connecting through support groups or agencies to avoid recruiting vulnerable individuals, for example, those who are at risk of experiencing emotional or psychological trauma as a result of the research process. People in certain communities may have past trauma associated with government and the research might expose vulnerabilities.
