# Ethical Practices for Research with Humans

As a researcher you will:

## Emotional wellbeing
- Recognize that for people from certain communities, sharing their personal stories and experiences of interacting with the government may bring up difficult emotions and memories tied to violence and/or traumas. As government officials interacting with people in vulnerable situations and experiences you should first acknowledge the historical relationships, inequity, trauma, and discrimination created by government and institutions.
- Provide the participants with a debriefing sheet that identifies contact information of local services, within their band or community, if they require support during or after the session.

## Anonymity and Privacy
- Be committed to respecting the confidentiality of the individuals that we speak to, and any other people, or events mentioned in their stories. The anonymity and privacy of people, who share their traumas and experiences, are guaranteed and paramount to any other interests.
- Ensure this intent translates into practice by de-identifying personal information
- Ensure all recordings, transcripts and notes will be held, archived, and disposed of in accordance with strict government security standards and policy.

## Setting
- Be committed to meeting people where and when they feel most comfortable speaking with us. Due to past experiences with government, some people might not like to meet us inside a government building.
- Meet them at a location of their convenience. For example, in their homes, offices or any location identified by the participant.
- Recognize that some individuals may prefer or need to speak with us outside regular 9 to 5 working hours
- Be flexible and accommodating in finding the right location for meeting

## Sharing insights and findings
- Be open to sharing research insights and findings with participants where appropriate while ensuring that participants are aware of our intentions and understand how their information is being used.

## Representation
- Include people with a cross-section of attributes that is representative of different geography, age, education, income, languages, sex, gender and people with varying levels of disabilities.

## Recruitment
- Recruit whenever possible by connecting through support groups or agencies to avoid recruiting vulnerable individuals, for example, those who are at risk of experiencing emotional or psychological trauma as a result of the research process. People in certain communities would have past trauma associated with government and the research might expose vulnerabilities.
