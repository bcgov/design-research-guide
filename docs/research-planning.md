# Problem Definition

Before you dive into solutions, you'll need to define the user problem you want to solve – and whether it's the right problem to be solving for. 

### Problem Statements 

A problem statement identifies the gap between the current state (i.e. the problem) and the desired state (i.e. the goal) of a process or product. Within the design context, you can think of the user problem as an unmet need. By designing a solution that meets this need, you can satisfy the user and ensure a pleasant user experience.

A good problem statement is human-centered and user-focused. Here are some tips for creating meaningful problem statements:
- #### Keep it focused but manageable. 
  - Problems should be specific enough to provide tangible direction without limiting room for other ideas and opportunities. 
- #### Focus on the User
  - Situate user needs at the forefront of your problem statement – user need statements to help contextualize and humanize the the problem you're solving for. 
- #### Consider the 4 W's 
  - Who is experiencing the problem? What is the problem? Where does the problem present itself? Why does it matter?)
- #### Use the 5 Whys
  - This technique can help you delve deeper into the problem to pinpoint root issues. 
  - HOW: Identify the problem and ask yourself why you feel this is an issue – repeat this process 5 times for a refined problem statement. 


# Defining the User Need(s)

The better you understand your users, the more likely you are to design and build a service that works well for them.

Who are our users? They are people who need to use the services you are working on. When designing or iterating a government service, start by learning about current and future users. If you don’t understand who the users are or what they need from your service, you can’t build the right thing.

### User Needs Statements
User need statements, also often called problem statements or point-of-view statements, are important in capturing what we want to achieve with our design, not how. They're used to summarize who a particular user is, the user’s need, and why the need is important to that user. It defines what you want to solve before you move on to generating potential solutions. 

Traditional need statements have 3 components
1) A user
2) A need
3) A goal

These are then combined following the pattern [A user] needs [need] in order to accomplish [goal].

- For example, [Alieda, a multitasking, tech-savvy mother of 2] needs [to quickly and confidently compare options without leaving her comfort zone] in order to [spend more time doing the things that really matter].


# Bringing the Team Along

Once ministry readiness, project expectations, and communications have been established, resources will need to be assigned to teams. Service design projects are usually made up of three teams:

- Core team: 3 to 5 people from the Strategic Design and Transformation Branch (SDTB) and the partnering ministry. This team conducts the service design work.
- Working group: A group of individuals with a vested interested in the project. The core team will present plans and findings along the way and request feedback.
- Steering committee: Ministry executive and the project or executive sponsor(s).

# Putting it All Together: The Research Plan

The research plan outlines the team’s approach to filling in the gaps for creating a better service. It outlines what the team needs to do to collect the rest of the understanding required for a successful service design project. 

The research plan outlines the goals, approach and logistics for research, and should include:

- Research objectives, key questions, and areas of interest
- Project background
- What kind of participants need to be involved, and how to recruit them
- The research approach including methods for research and analysis
- Research reporting plans
- Resources required, including team, time and budget
- A schedule for research activities and locations
- Support materials (if ready at this point in time) such as:
- Interview scripts and workshop outlines
- Recruiting screener to qualify research participants
- The research plan can and should be updated throughout the project, if required. This plan is simply a guide; the team may have to adapt on the fly to accommodate unexpected changes in schedules, participants or direction of the research. 

# How to Write User Research Questions

Good research begins with good questions. Your research questions should directly answer how you'll achieve your project and research goals. They will also inform the questions you want to ask users and stakeholders in the field (interviews, intercepts, shadowing, etc). 

Here's some pointers on how to ask good questions during user interviews:
#### Ask for Stories 
- Your questions should act as storytelling prompts to surface richer and chronological accounts of a user's experience. 
- E.g. "Tell me about a time when... , Walk me through a day in the life of..."
#### Use Curious Commands 
- Frame questions as an invitation to hear more about a user's experience or interaction. 
- E.g. "Describe a time when..., I'd love to hear more about..., 
#### Follow-Up & Dive Deeper
- Ask follow-up qustions for more details.
- E.g. "Could you elaborate on that further? What did you mean by..." 
#### Ask Neutral and Open-Ended Questions
- Avoid double-barrelled, leading, and yes/no questions – make sure your questions are only asking for one answer and leave room for further exploration.
