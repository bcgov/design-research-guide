# Design Research Guide

The BC Design Research Guide provides information on doing design research as a BC public servant.

>This guide assumes that you are doing research with participants over 19 years old who are capable of making their own decisions. If you are looking to do research with participants that do not fit with this description, please review information on [vulnerable populations and complex research](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/ethics/) to see if formal approvals are required.

<!--## It's About People and their Needs

**People donâ€™t wake up and think I wonder what the government of B.C. is doing today? I am going to visit their website to find out.** There is something that happened in their lives that drives them to use your service. Your service should fulfill this need and user research will help you understand what these needs are. -->


## Aligning to the Principles for Digital BC

Doing design research supports the following [digital principles](https://github.com/bcgov/digital-principles):

- Principle 1: Prioritize delivering impact for British Columbians
- Principle 2: Design with people & embed inclusion
- Principle 4: Continuously learn & improve
- Principle 10: Express cultural & historical awareness & respect
