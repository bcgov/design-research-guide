# Travel for Research

Getting out of the office and talking to people in their day-to-day life is at the heart of user research because context is important when trying to understand how people interact with a service.

The best research location is where the participant would actually access the service. This means you might need to meet people at home, work, school, or their favourite coffee shop.

Regional differences can also play an important part in understanding the needs of users and should be taken into account for your research. For example, a parent accessing child care in Vancouver will have a very different experience compared to a parent in Dawson Creek. Where someone lives can be important part of a GBA+ process.
