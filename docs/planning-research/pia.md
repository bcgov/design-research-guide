Under development and review
{: .label .label-yellow }

A [Privacy Impact Assessment](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy/privacy-impact-assessments) (PIA) is a process used to evaluate and manage privacy impacts, and to ensure compliance with privacy protection rules and responsibilities.

You must complete a PIA for user research if
- Your ministry doesn't already have a PIA for user research
- Your initiative hasn't included user research in their PIA

Work is being done to create a corporate PIA for user research.
