{: .label .label-yellow }

A [Privacy Impact Assessment](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy/privacy-impact-assessments) (PIA) is a process used to evaluate and manage privacy impacts, and to ensure compliance with privacy protection rules and responsibilities.

You must complete a PIA for design research if
- Your ministry doesn't already have a PIA for design research
- Your initiative hasn't included design research in their PIA

You may need to complete a PIA for remote research software.

Work is being done to create a corporate PIA for design research.
