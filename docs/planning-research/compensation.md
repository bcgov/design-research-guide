# Compensation & Stipends

Each person has their own perspective and experiences to share. The best way to acknowledge their input is to compensate them; especially when they are taking time away from work to give us their thoughts.

Compensation is good practice because

- We should compensate people for the time they spend with us, recognizing the value of their thoughts and opinions.
- There may be child care considerations, long commute times, or other reasons where unpaid research is not a high priority.
- People who are able to participate voluntarily generally have time or sufficient income to attend and this leads to poor sampling.
- If you conduct free user research, most people are unlikely to take time off from work to participate. A good question to ask yourself is “How likely are you to participate in a one-hour, unpaid interview, where you would have to take time off to travel to their office and provide feedback?” Usually that question will illustrate why paying participants will make their effort worthwhile.

You cannot compensate

- Employees or contractors of the BC Public Service
- Ministry stakeholders, service partners, or organizations receiving operating funding from the Province
- Participants who are part of a working group of the particular study or participants who are getting paid as part of their work to partake in the study
- Municipal or federal employees

## Compensation Amounts

Compensation should be appropriate in type and amount. The research team is responsible for assessing the level of compensation based on budget and number of participants.

All compensation should be provided fairly to all users in the same study, with equal compensation for equal participation regardless of income, age, gender, or race.

### Recommended Compensation

| Research Activity     | Duration        | Amount    |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Intercept Testing     | 10 to 15 minutes   | $10       |
| Behavioural Interview | 60 minutes      | $50       |
| Usability Testing     | 30 to 60 minutes | $25 - $50 |

## Forms of Compensation

The easiest way to provide compensation is with a stipend. Stipends are gift cards purchased at a certain dollar value.

When planning which gift cards to purchase
- Choose three to five options (for example, gas station, grocery store, restaurant)
- Think about your location of research. The location you are in will dictate which gift cards you offer. For example, not every city has an Esso or Save-on-Foods, but every region will have a gas station and grocery store. Look up what services are available in each location you are doing research.
- Avoid using prepaid Visas or Mastercards. These cards have an activation fee which are non-recoverable. Factor the activation fees into your budget if you choose to purchase prepaid cards.
- Let the participant select which gift card is best for them
- Work with your finance department to purchase gift cards.

Protocols for providing honorariums, gift giving, and elder payment when working with Indigenous peoples and First Nations.

## Proof of Compensation

A stipend receipt is required for compensation. You must create a record of proof that the participant received the compensation for accounting and auditing purposes. Gift cards can be perceived to be for personal use so these receipts are mandatory in case of a Freedom of Information request or audit.
