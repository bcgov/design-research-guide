# Compensation & Stipends

Each person has their own perspective and experiences to share. The best way to acknowledge their input is to compensate them; especially when they are taking time away from work to give us their thoughts.

Compensation is good practice because

- Not everyone has the luxury of donating their time to your user research project. There may be child care considerations, long commute times, or other reasons where unpaid research is not a high priority.
- People who are able to participate voluntarily generally have time or sufficient income to attend and this leads to poor sampling.
- If you conduct free user research, most people are unlikely to take time off from work to participate. A good question to ask yourself is “How likely are you to participate in a one-hour, unpaid interview, where you would have to take time off to travel to their office and provide feedback?” Usually that question will illustrate why paying participants will make their effort worthwhile.

You cannot compensate

- Employees or contractors of the BC Public Service
- Ministry stakeholders, service partners, or organizations receiving operating funding from the Province
- Participants who are part of a working group of the particular study or participants who are getting paid as part of their work to partake in the study
- Municipal or federal employees

## Compensation Amounts

Compensation should be appropriate in type and amount. The research team is responsible for assessing the level of compensation based on budget and number of participants.

All compensation should be provided fairly to all users in the same study, with equal compensation for equal participation regardless of income, age, gender, or race.

### Recommended Compensation

| Research Activity     | Duration        | Amount    |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Intercept Testing     | 10 to 15 minutes   | $10       |
| Behavioural Interview | 60 minutes      | $50       |
| Usability Testing     | 30 to 60 minutes | $25 - $50 |

## Forms of Compensation

The easiest way to provide compensation is with a stipend gift card. You should offer three to five options and let the participant select which is best for them. The city or region you are in will dictate which gift cards you offer. For example, not every city has an Esso or Save-on-Foods, but every region will have a gas station and grocery store.

Offering a prepaid Visa or Mastercard is also an option. This option costs more, as these cards come with an activation fee. Factor the activation fees into your budget if you go this route.

Work with your finance department to purchase gift cards or prepaid Visa cards.

**At this time, we are not able to provide electronic gift cards.**

## Proof of Compensation

A stipend receipt is required for compensation. You must create a record of proof that the participant received the compensation for accounting purposes.
