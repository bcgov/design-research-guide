# Plan the Research

## Start with Research Goals and Questions

Make sure you have defined your [research goal and questions](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/define-goals.html) with your team before planning the research.

## Choose Research Activities

Depending on your research goal and questions you'll need to choose the most appropriate research activities. Common qualitative research activities are

- [Behavioural interviews](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/activities/interviews.html)
- [Usability testing](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/activities/usability-testing.html)
- [Intercept testing](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/activities/intercept.html)
- Shadowing & observations

## Identify the Right Participants

Doing user research with real users of your service is the best way to get meaningful information. Asking for feedback from people in your office won't give you insight into how effective your service is at meeting user needs.

For government services, users can come from many places, but every service will have different types of users. There is no such thing as an "average user" or "average British Columbian".

## Specify Target Groups

Target groups are the specific groups of people you want to do research with. A great way to identify target groups would be to ask, "who will most likely use this service?" Criteria might be

- A particular demographic (for example, women under 30 years of age)
- A specific user group (for example, small business owners or internal staff)
- Specific life events (for example, users who have recently moved or are looking for a job)
- Specific access needs (for example, people who use assistive technology)
- A specific level of digital skill (for example, users who have basic online skills)

You will probably need to identify multiple target groups.

## Gender Based Analysis+ in Research

[Gender Based Analysis+](https://cfc-swc.gc.ca/gba-acs/index-en.html) (GBA+) is an analytical process used to assess how diverse groups of women, men and non-binary people, along with other intersecting factors may experience policies, programs and services differently. Across all target groups, you should use a GBA+ to inform your recruitment so you can understand the research question from the viewpoints of a diversity of people. Always try to recruit a representative spread of

- Age
- Gender
- Social and economic status
- Cultural and linguistic background
- Geographic location
- Education level

When you’ve defined your target groups, decide which groups you will include in each round of research. You might not be able to do research with every group identified in your first round of research. You should keep of record of these missing groups to show gaps in your research to make a case for further research.

## Number of Participants

There is no exact number of participants you need when completing user research. However, you would typically have between 4 and 8 participants for a round of [interviews](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/activities/interviews.html) or [usability tests](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/activities/usability-testing.html) with each [target group](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/planning-research/#specify-target-groups). After 5 sessions you should see patterns in answers and themes emerging. You don't need a huge sample size in [qualitative research](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/understand-user-research.html#qualitative-vs-quantitative) to get value insights.

## Create a Budget

User research doesn’t have to be expensive, but there are some costs to consider like

- [Travel](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/planning-research/travel.html)
  - Type of transportation (for example, airfare)
  - Accommodation
  - Per diems
- [Participant compensation](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/planning-research/compensation.html)
- Catering (if applicable)
