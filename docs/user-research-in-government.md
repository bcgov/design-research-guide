# Getting Approval

Approval may be required before you start research. Key questions that your executive/ADM/DM may ask include:

- Who will you be talking to? And how many?
- Do you require a budget for travel and stipends?
- Have you completed the necessary privacy and PIA requirements?

Creating a formal Research Plan is a good way to capture all the requirements and research scope. **Jump to the Research Plan section**

# Privacy and PIA Requirements

Government ministries and other public bodies must collect, use, disclose, store and dispose of personal information appropriately to protect personal privacy. 

## What is personal information?
[The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/Recon/document/ID/freeside/96165_00) defines personal information as recorded information about an identifiable individual. This can include, but is not limited to:

- biographical details (name, sex, age, race)
- biological details (face, fingerprints, blood type, etc.)
- nationality
- religion
- marital status
- education
- medical or criminal history
- financial information
- identification number (SIN)
- contact details (address, phone numbers, etc.)
- personal opinions and views

## Privacy Impact Assessment

A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is a process used to evaluate and manage privacy impacts and to ensure compliance with privacy protection rules and responsibilities.

For government, completing a PIA is a legislative requirement. You must complete a PIA when you are developing or changing an enactment, system, project, program or activity. A PIA can make the difference between an initiative that invades privacy and one that enhances it. A PIA must still be completed even if you determine that there is no personal information being collected, used or disclosed. Work with your ministry's Privacy Officer to complete a PIA for user research.

# Staffing and Time Requirements

Good research requires time. Expect members of your research team to dedicate at least 50 per cent of their workday to the project. While this may not be an out-of-pocket expense, it could require temporarily shifitng staff responsibilties. Of course, hiring a full-time user research role is always an option. 

# Securing a Budget

We often hear from ministries that they want to do user research, but don't have room in their budget to make it happen. User research doesn't have to be expensive, but there are some key costs to consider.

## Travel
Getting out and talking to people is the heart of user research. The Service Design team likes to meet people where they are; home, work, school, or their favourite coffee shop. We also like to conduct interviews in different regions of the province. A parent accessing child care in Vancouver will have a very different experience compared to a parent in Dawson Creek. 

- **Preferred Travel Budget:** 
Two team members meeting people in multiple regions of the province (hotel, airfare, car rental, taxi or public transportation, per diems). 
**Example:** Surrey, Kelowna, Prince George, Nanaimo
*Approximately $4,000*

- **Low Cost Travel Budget:** 
Two team members meeting people in their community and one to two neighbouring communities (mileage costs, taxi or public transportation, per diems). 
**Example:** Victoria, Langford, Duncan
*Approximately $300*

- **No Cost Travel Budget:**
Two team members meeting people in their community, hosting interviews at government locations when appropriate (taxi or public transportation). 
**Example:** Victoria
*Approximately $0-$50*

## Stipends
Each person has their own perspective and experiences to share. The best way to acknowledge their input is to compensate them; especially when they are taking time away from work to give us their thoughts.

Compensation is good practice:

- Not everyone has the luxury of donating their time to your user research project. There may be child care considerations, long commute times, or other reasons where unpaid research is not a high priority.
- People who are able to participate voluntarily generally have time or sufficient income to attend and this leads to poor sampling.
- If you conduct free user research, most people are unlikely to take time off from work to participate. A good question to ask yourself is *"How likely are you to participate in a one-hour, unpaid interview, where you would have to take time off to travel to their office and provide feedback?"* Usually that question will illustrate why paying participants will make their effort worthwhile.

Depending on who you interview, compensation may not be required:

- Employees or contractors of the BC Public Service
- Ministry stakeholders, service partners, or organizations receiving operating funding from the province
- Participants who are part of a working group of the particular study or participants who are getting paid as part of their work to partake in the study

- **Stipend Budget:** $0 and up **Read the detailed compensation guide**
