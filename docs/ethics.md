# Ethics
Every user research presents some type of risk to the participant. Types of risks may include:

- physical
- social
- psychological/emotional
- repercussions for (or for not) participating

User researchers are responsible for participantâ€™s confidentiality and reducing the risks of conducting research. A good question to ask yourself is "Is the level of risk greater than what the user would encounter in their everyday lives?" If the answer is a maybe or yes, please consult with the Service Design Team.
