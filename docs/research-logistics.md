The focus of your research determines who you recruit and how many people you recruit. Consider recruiting people of different ages, ethnicities, genders, and life circumstances to capture a wide variety of experiences and perspectives.

Recruitment takes time and is a key step in user research. Don't rush this process!

# How Many Research Participants Do I Need?

There is no one exact number you need to achieve when completing user research. Qualitative research focuses on the depth and breadth of information collected. Here's how we determine if we've recruited and interviewed enough users.

### Are different types of users represented?

Narrowing down user needs when there are multiple users is hard. However, if you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one.

- **Tool experience:** How familiar is the user with how to use the website, application, and/or product/service?
- **Program experience:** How familiar is the user with programs and/or services that surround the tool?
- **Domain experience:** How knowledgeable is the user about this content?

### Have we heard from a diverse set of users?

Is the mix of users you are speaking to a reflection of the diversity one might see in the overall population? This is where GBA+ can help with recruitment.

- **Accessbility:** Users with special needs are often good at articulating the problems more than generic users might experience, but have a harder time putting their finger on it.
- **Extreme use cases:** Extreme users tend to have the same needs as the average users, but their needs are much more amplified. This is the opposite of the common approach to defining users very broadly. For example, "everyone in BC is my user group."

### Are themes beginning to emerge?

Patterns in user answers typically begin to form after you've interviewed five different people. Again, this is approximate and there no one exact number. We don’t need huge sample sizes to find usable insights.

# Finding the Right Research Participants

Depending on who your target audience is, there will be multiple ways to recruit users. Consider what is most suitable and relevant for your project.

**Recruitment Channels:**
- Ministry stakeholders
- Ministry service partners or organizations receiving operating funding from the province
- ServiceBC
- Social media and social networks
- Community groups and non-profit organizations
- Referrals from other users
- Referrals from BC public servants

**Intercept Recruitment Locations:**
- Public places (libraries, parks, shopping centres, university/college campuses)
- ServiceBC offices
- Ministry service partners

If you ask stakeholders or service partners to help you contact users, give a clear picture of the kinds of participants you are looking for. For example, if your research topic is focused on student loans, you are recruiting participants who are applying for or currently receiving BC student loans.

# Writing Recruitment Messages

A recruitment message is an easy way to quickly describe your research project to potential participants. Depending on where and how the message will be send out, the length and level of detail will vary.

Asking stakeholders or community groups to send out your recruitment messaging through their established communication channels is a great way to connect with users who may not typically engage with government. Channels like email newsletters and Facebook pages often yield a large number of user responses.

**Essential elements to include:**
- Brief overview of what the project wants to achieve
- Qualifying user statement or question
- Time commitment/estimated interview length
- Researcher contact information
- Date range when interviews will be scheduled
- Compensation (if applicable)

### Sample Recruitment Message, Participant

*Are you a parent or guardian of a child with autism spectrum disorder?*

*If so, we are interested in speaking to you about government autism services. The Province is improving how families learn about and use government autism services. We'd like to spend approximately 60 minutes with you to better understand your needs and your challenges when accessing autism information and utilizing funding.*

*What’s in it for you? You’ll receive a $50 gift card as a thank you for your time. We are scheduling interviews for January. If you are interested, please contact jane.doe@gov.bc.ca or call 250-555-1234 by January 4.*

*We will be qualifying participants. Please note, only those selected to participate in the research will be eligible for compensation.*

### Sample Recruitment Message, Stakeholder/Service Provider

*To Whom It May Concern:*

*We are working on a project with the Ministry of Child and Family Development to improve how families, providers, and organizations like yourself learn about and use government autism services. MCFD identified **Service Provider Name** as a key contact for the project because of your connections to families who may have a child diagnosed with ASD, or who are in the process of pursuing a diagnosis.*

*We’re doing research to better understand the needs and challenges that families may encounter when accessing autism information and funding.There are two ways we’re hoping you can help.*

*1. Could we schedule an interview with yourself or one of your colleagues who has experience working with families navigating autism information and services, for us to learn from you about the needs and challenges you see and how you provide services?*

*2. Could you help connect us with families who may be interested in participating in the project? A large part of our work is talking to parents and caregivers across the province about their stories, challenges and successes with autism services in B.C. Sessions will take place in the first three weeks of January. We go to where parents/caregivers are – in their homes, at work, or a place they feel comfortable – and spend about an hour getting to know them and hearing about their experiences. These longer behavioural interviews help our research focus on the entire parent journey. We typically need about an hour with each person, but can accommodate a shorter interview. All parents/caregivers interviewed received a stipend as a thank you for their time.*

*If you have further questions, feel free to give us a call, and please let us know if there is a good time to meet in person. Thank you in advance for your time. Your involvement will help us better understand needs and  identify opportunities to improve autism information and service delivery in B.C.*

# Screening Participants

A screener is a list of criteria used to check whether or not your potential participant would match with the characteristics of your target audience. Screening participants also helps you meet your research requirements.

It’s fine if the individual is not a strong match. It saves your time and the individual’s time. Thank them for their interest in the project and for sharing their story, and ask if they are open to you contacting them in the future for other research projects.

### Sample Screener

- Your location/community:
- Family status:
- Age of child at autism diagnosis:
- Current age of child:
- Availability during the week of January 14:

# Scheduling Interviews

Once participants have been screened and selected, it is important to keep them informed about their participation in the interview process. When scheduling an interview, be flexible, but firm when picking a date, time and location to meet.

**For example:**
- "We are scheduling interviews in Victoria on Monday, January 13 and Tuesday, January 14 between 8am and 6pm."
- "We will be in your community next Friday and have availability to meet at 1:30pm or 4pm."
- "We are happy to host you at our meeting space downtown. If you prefer, we could also meet at your home or office."

Whenver possible, use a participant's preferred method of communication (phone call, email, or text) to contact them when the interview date is set. It's also good practice to give them a courtesy reminder a day in advance of the interview.

**A note for researchers.** While it's tempting to schedule as many interviews as possible in one day, we know from experience this isn't good for anyone.

- **Interviews are tiring.** Interviewing, active listening, observing, and note-taking require a high degree of focus.

- **Interviews can be emotionally taxing.** Depending on your research topic, users may share highly sensitive and emotional stories. Giving yourself enough time to process and recover is very important.

We recommend scheduling no more than four one-hour interviews per day. Leave a buffer of at least 45 minutes between interviews.

# Picking Interview Locations

A good interview location is one that is easy for the user to access and makes them feel comfortable. We like to offer multiple options and let the user pick which is best for them.

- **User's home**
- **User's place of employment**
- **Government office/meeting room**
- **Local coffee shop or restaurant**
- **Community organization**

No matter where the interview takes place, try to create a safe, comfortable, and quiet space where your user can speak honestly about the subject.

# Interview Roles and Responsibilites

Conduct your research in pairs. One person will ask questions and the other person will take notes and photos. The interviewer should focus on the interviewee and the notetaker is there to support and document the interview.

### Before the interview, mentally prepare

- The user is the expert in their own experience. Observe and listen to them so as to understand their experience.
- The insights of the user are facts as they believe them to be. There are no wrong answers in the interview.
- Approach the user ready to hear their story and their perspective. Before the interview, check your assumptions and internal biases.
- Be mentally present and focused in the moment.

### Starting the interview

- Introduce yourselves. Users may want to spend some time getting to know you before they open up to you.
- Share the purpose of the interview and confirm with the user they understand. Let them know they can ask questions if they are confused or don't understand what you are asking.
- Explain the consent form and ask the user to sign it.
- Start the recording device (if using) and begin the interview.
- Be silent if the user seems to be thinking or mulling something over. Allow them time to think. Get comfortable with long pauses. Always be mindful of the user’s comfort level. Pull back when necessary and go in deeper when possible.
- Remember, smile and make eye contact.

# Paying Research Participants

Each person has their own perspective and experiences to share. The best way to acknowledge their input is to compensate them; especially when they are taking time away from work to give us their thoughts.

Compensation is good practice:

- Not everyone has the luxury of donating their time to your user research project. There may be child care considerations, long commute times, or other reasons where unpaid research is not a high priority.
- People who are able to participate voluntarily generally have time or sufficient income to attend and this leads to poor sampling.
- If you conduct free user research, most people are unlikely to take time off from work to participate. A good question to ask yourself is *"How likely are you to participate in a one-hour, unpaid interview, where you would have to take time off to travel to their office and provide feedback?"* Usually that question will illustrate why paying participants will make their effort worthwhile.

Depending on who you interview, compensation may not be required:

- Employees or contractors of the BC Public Service
- Ministry stakeholders, service partners, or organizations receiving operating funding from the province
- Participants who are part of a working group of the particular study or participants who are getting paid as part of their work to partake in the study

## Compensation Amounts

Compensation should be appropriate in type and amount. The research team is responsible for assessing the level of compensation.

All compensation should be provided fairly to all users in the same study, with equal compensation for equal participation regardless of income, age, gender, race.

### Recommended compensation

| Type of Research | Duration of Interview | Compensation |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
| Intercept    | 10-15 minutes      | $10 |
| One-on-One Interview  | 30 minutes      | $25  |
| One-on-One Interview  | 60 minutes      | $50  |
| One-on-One Interview with an Expert* | 60 minutes      | $100 and up  |
| Usability Testing | 30 minutes      | $25  |
| Usability Testing | 60 minutes      | $50  |
* An expert could be a lawyer, doctor, or other professional who would lose billable hours out of their day by participating in an interview. Compensate them accordingly.

### Forms of compensation

The easiest way to provide compensation is a gift card. We like to offer 3-5 options and let the user select which is best for them. The city or region you are in will dictate which gift cards you offer. For example, not every city has an Esso or Save-on-Foods, but every region will have a gas station and grocery store.

Offering a prepaid Visa or Mastercard is also an option. This option costs more, as these cards come with an activation fee. Factor the activation fees into your budget if you go this route.

At this time, we are not able to provide e-gift cards.

# Consent Forms

The purpose of a consent form is for both users and researchers of the session to understand and agree on:

- Who is collecting the data
- The purpose of the study (Why you are collecting the data)
- Any recordings that will happen during the session and how information will be handled
- What type of information will be recorded
- How the information is going to be used
- Who to contact if there are any questions

**A separate consent form is required for compensation.**

## Consent Form Criteria

- Only share information with the people working on this project
- Anonymize your notes
- Do not intentionally ask for personal information if it is not necessary
- Store data on an encrypted government device
- Review the consent form and fill in parts that are necessary

# Recording the Interview & Equipment Requirements

### Recording

With informed consent, you may choose to record the test session. You must inform the user:

- What the recording is for
- How you will protect personal information
- That their personal information, such as stories and experiences, will not be associated with them

### Equipment

The equipment for this kind of research is simple and low-tech. If you have received consent to capture audio, use a recording device, such as a smartphone.

We prefer to take notes, often verbatim, on a laptop. This saves time during analysis. In circumstances where using a laptop is not appropriate, hand-written notes are okay.

When conducting usuability testing, a laptop and screen-recording software will be required. Check with the Service Design Team for suggestions on what screen-recording software to use.

If the user has consented to photography, a smartphone is perfectly fine. A large DSLR or digital camera can be intimidating.

# Data Collection and Storage

Recordings from user research sessions are considered records and should be handled like other ministry records. Please consult with your records manager for best practice.

### What needs to be stored?

For record keeping and auditing purposes, you will need to safely store:
- Signed consent form as a record for participating in the study
- Compensation form for auditing purposes

We also recommend storing the users anonymized analysis separate from their personal information. Doing this will decrease the risk of associating personal information with what came out of the session.
