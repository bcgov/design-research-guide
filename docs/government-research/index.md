# User Research in Government

## Getting Approval

Approval may be required before you start research. Key questions that your executive/ADM/DM may ask include:

- Who will you be talking to? And how many?
- Do you require a budget for travel and stipends?
- Have you completed the necessary privacy and PIA requirements?

Creating a formal [Research Plan](https://bcgov.github.io/user-research-guide/research-planning.html#putting-it-all-together-the-research-plan) is a good way to capture all the requirements and research scope. **Jump to the Research Plan section**

## Staffing and Time Requirements

Good research requires time. Expect members of your research team to dedicate at least 50 per cent of their workday to the project. While this may not be an out-of-pocket expense, it could require temporarily shifting staff responsibilities. Of course, hiring a full-time user research role is always an option.
