# Privacy and PIA Requirements

Government ministries and other public bodies must collect, use, disclose, store and dispose of personal information appropriately to protect personal privacy.

## What is personal information?
[The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/Recon/document/ID/freeside/96165_00) defines personal information as recorded information about an identifiable individual. This can include, but is not limited to:

- biographical details (name, sex, age, race)
- biological details (face, fingerprints, blood type, etc.)
- nationality
- religion
- marital status
- education
- medical or criminal history
- financial information
- identification number (SIN)
- contact details (address, phone numbers, etc.)
- personal opinions and views

## Privacy Impact Assessment

A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is a process used to evaluate and manage privacy impacts and to ensure compliance with privacy protection rules and responsibilities.

For government, completing a PIA is a legislative requirement. You must complete a PIA when you are developing or changing an enactment, system, project, program or activity. A PIA can make the difference between an initiative that invades privacy and one that enhances it. A PIA must still be completed even if you determine that there is no personal information being collected, used or disclosed. Work with your ministry's Privacy Officer to complete a PIA for user research.
