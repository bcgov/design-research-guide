# Research Activities

Depending on your [research goal and questions](https://bcgov.github.io/design-research-guide/define-goals.html) you'll need to choose the most appropriate research activities. Common qualitative research activities are

- [Behavioural interviews](https://bcgov.github.io/design-research-guide/activities/interviews.html)
- [Usability testing](https://bcgov.github.io/design-research-guide/activities/usability-testing.html)
- [Intercept testing](https://bcgov.github.io/design-research-guide/activities/intercept.html)

It's usually preferable to conduct design research in person. Face-to-face interactions allow you to quickly build trust with participants, encouraging them to tell rich stories while you can observe subtleties in what they are thinking, feeling and doing.

## Remote Research
If you can't meet participants in person or it would be less effective, you can conduct [design research remotely](https://bcgov.github.io/design-research-guide/activities/remote-research.html).
