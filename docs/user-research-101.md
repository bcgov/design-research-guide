# What is User Research?

User research is a study of who the users of a service are, how they behave and what their motivations for using the service are. We hear from people in their own words, so we may gain an understanding of what they want and need from government.

## Why is User Research Important?

Learning about users allows you to create better government services. You will discover the user’s motivations, struggles and goals for a service. The role of a user researcher is not to consult with, audit, and/or teach users. The role of a user researcher is to actively observe and listen without bias or assumptions.

User research helps us:

- discover the need for the products and services sooner rather than later
- establish a good foundation to make sure you are designing the best products, services and systems
- lower cost of projects in the long term
- improve processes to deliver services faster and more responsively
- reduce the number of user inquiries and complaints
- provide value to users, leading to better user experience

## When to do Research

User research can be used across the lifecycle of a project, from initial discovery through to implementation and maintenance.

- The most important role for user research is at the beginning of a project. It helps ensure that the right problems are being solved and will provide a strong foundation for the project strategy and vision.
- User research provides clarity for better solutions. It allows you to explore solutions based on the real-world context of users and other stakeholders.
- Research leads to making design and policy decisions based on evidence instead of on opinion, personal agendas or current management trends. It helps during the scoping of features and functions for a service and in the iterative refinement of prototyping and testing to create a polished service.
- Research helps measure your progress on an ongoing basis. Research tools can contribute to meaningful metrics and key performance indicators that are based on success for both stakeholders and the organization, rather than arbitrary targets

## Qualitative vs. Quantitative

Quantitative measures are an important part of understanding a problem. Those familiar with quantitative research look for statistical significance. Qualitative research is different. Finding a balance is important. This is especially true when you need to understand why something happens, know where there are unmet needs, establish new services, or optimize existing ones. Quantitative measures are good for telling us what happens. Qualitative methods build on that to explore the why and the how.

Acknowledging the difference between the two research methods is important. For quantitatively-based project partners, discuss with them how usable insights from the qualitative side give colour and human insight to the quantitative data to which they have access. While quantitative data informs service effectiveness quite well, qualitative data leads to services that are easy, effective, and emotionally resonant and can come from any individual. Remember, we don’t need huge sample sizes to find usable insights.
