# Define the Research Goals
Before starting any research, you should understand:

- What you’re trying to achieve (do you want to understand your users’ behaviour, try out new features or both?)
- Which problems you’re trying to solve
- Which assumptions or beliefs about your users or service you want to test
- What you need to know now to be able to make an informed decision about what to do next

## Create Research Goals

User research should have clear goals. Work with your team to agree what you want to learn from your research. Keep your goals actionable and to the point.

**Example Research Goal:** Identify the challenges of enrolling in the B.C. Medical Services Plan as a new immigrant

## Create Research Questions

Your research question(s) is what you need to learn to achieve your research goal, not the questions you'll ask in a session. You can use research questions to help you plan and prioritize user research.

**Example Research Questions:**
- How do new immigrants learn about the Medical Services Plan?
- Are there external supports new immigrants use to access the enrollment application?
- How many new immigrants use the digital form versus the paper form? Why?

Your research goals and questions will help you decide which qualitative and quantitative methods you need and which research activities to use. You'll use this information to start planning your research logistics.
