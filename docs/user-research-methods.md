# User Research Methods

## One-on-One Interviews

One-on-One interviews are open-ended interviews that focus on participants' behaviour. These interviews help uncover values, motivations, priorities, activities, and relationships about a particular service or experience. Interviews connect the research team with real people and they allow the team to investigate the underlying issues of a service that may not have been discovered through analytics or surveys.

### Steps
- Determine what topics you want to cover for your interview
- Create an interview guide for your questions. Use this as a guide to help keep you on track and to make sure you can fit your questions into the available time.
- Interview participants by exploring each topic using open-ended questions. Invite further explanation of interesting topics, anecdotes or other feelings.
- Record notes during the interview of exactly what the person is saying, not what you think they are saying.
- Provide the participant with a gift or stipend to thank them for their time.

## Intercepts

Intercept interviews are short interviews with users following a service transaction. The interview aims to capture the user’s thoughts on a service while the interaction is still fresh in their mind.

Intercept interviews are a useful way of surveying the opinions of a broad sample of users in a short time. These interviews take place in service settings like Service BC Centres. Researchers often ask all participants a set of standard open-ended questions.

### Steps

- Think about sample size and ethics (consent forms, incentives, information sheets) before you begin.
- Choose an appropriate location (or locations) to conduct your intercept interviews and talk to the managers who run them.
- Develop a short and focused interview guide. Keep this concise – on average you're hoping for 5 to 20 minutes of a participant’s time, so you don’t want too many questions.
- Proceed as you would an one-on-one interview (conduct, record, provide stipend)
- Wrap up with clarifying any outstanding questions, and if possible, follow up with an invitation for a longer interview.

## Shadowing & Observation

Shadowing and observation is about spending time observing a user in the context of their life at home or at work. Watching someone’s behaviour can surface new insights beyond what people say in an interview. Observation and shadowing can be followed up with an interview based on what was observed to dig deeper into their behaviour.

### Steps
- Recruit users like you would for a one-on-one interview.
- Confirm that they understand that you're going to spend some time shadowing their activities. When shadowing BC Public Service employees, it's important to explain you're not there to judge their work. This is not about job performance!
- Ask the user to show you what they do. Depending on your research topic you may focus on specific activities, or have them carry on a "typical day" for a broader focus. Have your participant explain things as if you know nothing about their work.
- Let the person explain their work over the time that you spend together. Approach an observation session just like an intern or someone new on the job. Ask follow-up questions to clarify, especially points most relevant to your areas of interest.
- Give the user some language in advance to explain to others why you're with them. For example, "Oh, Jim is from the Intranet project and is tagging along with me today to learn more about my work."
- Wrap up by having them clarify any outstanding questions, or conduct a more formal interview.

## Usability Testing

Usability testing is a way to uncover issues with your service by testing it with real users. Users perform a series of tasks while being observed to see where they encounter problems or become confused. By testing with multiple users, recurring issues will be identified as areas of improvement. Usability testing is often used for website or application prototypes, but can be used to test other services as well.

### Steps

- Identify what areas of your service you want to test. This could be new content, an online application, or a user's journey through a website.
- Create a list of tasks for users to complete. These can be used as prompts during the test. Remember, you don't want to tell the user what to do.
- Conduct the test. Have one person moderate and one person take notes. Again, you want to observe. Avoid helping or leading users while completing a task. Users will surprise you!
- Remind users you are testing the service, not them. Any issues they encounter is a problem with the service, not their inability.
- If possible, try to screen record the session for later analysis. This is also useful footage to have when presenting to executive sponsors or to your development team.
- Compile all your findings from the test to identify areas of improvement. These may be small usability issues or larger problems with the whole service.
- A majority of usability issues will be uncovered after 3 to 5 tests.
