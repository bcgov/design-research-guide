# Design Research Guide
The BC User Research Guide provides documentation and instruction on doing design research as a BC public servant. The [draft version of the guide](https://bcgov.github.io/design-research-guide/) is being developed in Github and can be read using Github pages

>The guide assumes that you are doing research with participants over 19 years old who are capable of making their own decisions. If you are looking to do research with participants that do not fit with this description, please review information on complex research and see if formal approvals are required.

## Aligning to the Principles for Digital BC

- Principle 1: Prioritize delivering impact for British Columbians
